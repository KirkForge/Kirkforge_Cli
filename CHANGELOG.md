## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (deep audit — second pass)
- Approval diff-preview reader now checks `canonicalize() → starts_with(cwd)` before opening any file; blocks `../../../../etc/passwd`-style read-leak via the approval dialog
- `notified_jobs` HashSet pruned each tick to registry-live IDs only — bounded at ≤64 entries instead of growing for the session lifetime
- Toolset startup `panic!` replaced with `anyhow::Result` propagation so a plugin inconsistency produces a clean error instead of a process abort
- `state.messages` display list capped at 2 000 entries; oldest 500 evicted when exceeded with index-based state (collapsed, expanded, search) remapped consistently

### Added
- `/plugins` slash-command family for runtime plugin mount/unmount: `list`, `enable <name>`, `disable <name>`, `reload`, `trust <name> <tier>`. The executor picks up the new registry snapshot on the next turn without restarting.
- `--log-level` flag (default `warn`; env `KIRKFORGE_LOG_LEVEL`); `RUST_LOG` still overrides
- `kirkforge completions <bash|zsh|fish|powershell>` — prints shell completion script
- Cargo.toml metadata: `repository`, `license`, `keywords`, `categories`

### Changed
- Default model changed from `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` to `qwen2.5:7b` so fresh Ollama installs work out of the box
- `NO_COLOR` / `TERM=dumb` now detected at startup; falls back to line-mode instead of TUI

### Fixed
- Config file (`~/.local/share/kirkforge/config.toml`) now created with `0o600` permissions instead of world-readable `0644`; all three write paths covered (create, hot-reload, `save_config`)
- TUI exit no longer hangs for minutes when an Ollama HTTP call is in-flight:
  - cancel signal sent before channel drop
  - `handle.await` wrapped in a 3-second timeout
- `/exit` and `/quit` slash commands now abort an in-flight model call before setting `should_exit`
- Approval dialog: `Q` / `Esc` deny without exit; `^C` deny and exit; hint line updated so users know how to escape
- Block-comment closer split across a line boundary no longer breaks syntax highlighting
- Model HTTP calls retry up to 3× on connect/timeout errors and 429/503 responses (exponential backoff: 1 s, 2 s, 4 s)
- Default deny list extended with `**/.gnupg/**` and `**/.aws/**`
