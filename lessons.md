# Lessons — WO 43 session

- Backlog dumps from earlier assessments drift FAST in this repo. ~11 of the
  user's ~25 claims were stale (test code mistaken for prod, shipped features
  re-listed as gaps, moved files). Always re-verify file:line before writing
  a WO. The parallel-agent + verify-then-write pattern worked well.
- scout.rs:138 unimplemented!() is #[cfg(test)]-only — the "live panic path"
  claim was wrong. Verified by direct read, not just agent report.
- WO README index + `## Status` header keyword agreement is enforced by
  `cargo test -p kf-budget-core --test adr_xref_drift` — new WO series MUST
  add README rows in the same commit. "Planned" is a recognized keyword.
- proptest is already a root dev-dependency; kf-routing just needs the one-liner.
- Several "missing" features already shipped under other WOs: MCP content-hash
  consent (42.5), Windows rename retry, landlock default-on (ADR-054 amendment),
  seccomp opt-in (30.4), WO 7.6 Done. Check state.md Shipped list first.
- Commit landed on `main` (this checkout's working branch; main==dev per
  state.md). Not pushed — user did not request push.
