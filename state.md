# kf-code Repo State

*Current state only. History lives in `git log` and WO files.*

## Shipped (closed this session)

- **WO 41.0-41.9**: ALL Done (series complete).
- **WO 42.0-42.12**: ALL Done (series complete). 42.0 overview closed.
- **WO 38.9**: items 1-6 all done (was 30%, now 100%). Closed.
- **WO 32.15**: Done (landlock FS confinement integration test).
- **WO 40.4**: Done (test sleeps eliminated; residual documented).
- **Stale statuses fixed**: 14.6, 27.0-27.7, 28.6, 31.0, 32.3, 32.4, 33.0, 33.4,
  33.9 — all marked Done in their WO files + README index (WO status drift test
  enforces the two-source-of-truth agreement).

## Pending / Deferred (open)

- **WO 39.4**: Claude compat phase 3 (hook stdin-JSON contract + generic
  pre/post-tool events). Deferred — lowest wild frequency of the artifact
  classes. Tracked in [39.4](docs/workorders/39.4-claude-compat-phase3.md).
- **WO 39.1 Phase 3-4**: external runner for `claude -p`/`codex exec`/`opencode
  run` + same-model LiteLLM gateway. Phase 1-2 done. Tracked in
  [39.1](docs/workorders/39.1-bench-cross-tool.md).
- **WO 38.10 P2s**: `--read-stdin-full` flag, JSON error-object emission,
  session.id in summary, replay/Ctrl-C/CLI polish. P0+P1 done. Tracked in
  [38.10](docs/workorders/38.10-cli-first-run.md).
- **WO 19.11**: plugin production hardening (partial). Tracked in
  [19.11](docs/workorders/19.11-plugin-production-hardening.md).
- **WO 21.0.14**: deferred tracker (tracking — this is the ledger of all
  deferrals, kept open by design). Tracked in
  [21.0.14](docs/workorders/21.0.14-deferred-tracker.md).
- **WO 29.1**: fold bundled plugin into compiled-in Rust tools — Phase 1
  shipped; verify tools deferred to 29.7. Tracked in
  [29.1](docs/workorders/29.1-fold-bundled-plugin.md).

## Known flakes (pre-existing, not introduced this session)

- `same_ms_double_spawn_gets_distinct_{temp_dirs,worktrees}` — real-concurrency git tests, `#[cfg(unix)]` gated, flake under extreme parallel load. Pass in isolation.

## Architecture notes (load-bearing, not in WOs)

- `VerifierHandler::verify_event` caches verdicts keyed by `(file_path, content_hash)`.
  Only `Clean`/`Skipped` verdicts are cached — `Fixable`/`Unfixable` are not (the
  correction loop re-verifies after applying a fix; disk content changed, so a
  cached verdict would be stale). After a fix is applied, `CorrectionLoop::run`
  calls `invalidate_cache(path)` to drop the stale entry. `content_hash == 0`
  events never hit the cache (old events / producers without hash). WO 42.11.

- `Message.token_count` is populated at append time (`ConversationLog::append`/`append_async`). Estimators (`estimate_message_tokens` in `prompt/mod.rs`) return the cached value when `Some`, falling back to BPE counting when `None`. Content mutation sites (`truncate_tool_results`, `dedup_adjacent_tool_results`, `minify_old_messages`, `stub_old_tool_results`, compaction stub/condense) clear `token_count = None` to avoid stale cache. WO 42.12.

- `panic = "abort"` in release — panic hook (WO 38.2) restores terminal before abort. Keep abort (binary size); don't switch to unwind without measuring.
- Budget guard wired in production (WO 38.8) — `set_budget_stores` + `set_stratum_store` called from `run_session.rs`. Listener registry is session-keyed `HashMap`, not the old append-only Vec.
- Windows cross-compile gate in `scripts/ci-local.sh` — `cargo clippy --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` runs before every push. AGENTS.md §4 enforces it. This is the structural fix for the 25+ `fix(windows)` commit pattern.
- WO drift test in `kf-budget-core/tests/adr_xref_drift.rs` — enforces WO file header ↔ README index agreement. Prevents future status drift. `wo_status_headers_match_readme_index` is one of its 5 checks.
- `.config/nextest.toml` profiles: `ci-fast` (30s, fail-fast), `ci-full` (60s), `nightly` (600s). CI references by name, no inline `--config`.

## CI / branch state

- **CI: GREEN.** `cargo nextest run --profile ci-fast --workspace --lib --bins --locked`
  → 4518 passed, 0 failed, 16 skipped. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean. `cargo fmt --check` clean. `adr_xref_drift` 5/5 passed.
- **main == dev** at SHA `ff7d8132`.
